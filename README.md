## Mission Goals
- Support mastery learning of computer science concepts while building a professional grade 3D VR multiplayer game with the <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/cs1?path=README.md:1:0" rel="noopener noreferer">CS1 Game Engine</a>.
- Help learners maintain focus while demonstrating formative understanding and building project based evidence of learning.
- Help educators design and manage their own custom curricular content.

## First Steps
- Watch the **Video Overview**.
- <a href="https://bit.ly/cs1-ide-remix" rel="noopener noreferer">Remix</a> this IDE project.
- <a href="https://bit.ly/cs1-remix" rel="noopener noreferer">Remix</a> the CS1 Game Engine base project.
- Add an **ADMIN_KEY** in the **.env** of your base project remix.
- Customize the **name** of your base project remix.
- Log into the **CS1 IDE** with your **base project remix name** and **ADMIN_KEY**.
- Create your own lesson content and update **public/components/lessons/templates.mjs**.

## Extended Language Support
Although the **CS1 IDE** and **CS1 Game Engine** are written in **JavaScript**, plans are in the works for **Java** and **Python** language integration. These plans include a **Java Spark** based microservice project and **JSweet** transpiled client code project to eventually integrate into the **CS1 IDE** and talk to **CS1 Game Engine** projects.  Down the road this will enable students to learn with **Java** based lesson sets. In the same spirit I aim to design and build a **Python Flask** based microservice and **Transcrypt** based browser client so that students can use the **CS1 IDE** with **Python** based lesson sets.
